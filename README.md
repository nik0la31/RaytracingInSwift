# Brute Force Ray Tracing in Swift

This project implements brute force ray tracing following [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley. The original book uses C++, but I am using it as a learning exercise to explore Swift.

## Features

* Basic ray tracing implementation
* Written in Swift
* Following the step-by-step approach from the book

## Why Swift?

While the topic is familiar, Swift is new to me. This project serves as a hands-on way to learn the language while working on a concept I enjoy.
